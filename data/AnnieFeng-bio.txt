I am from Johns Creek, Georgia, USA. Since studying EECS in college, I've developed my interests in AI and robotics and an appreciation for mathematics and physics. I'm an aspiring AI engineer and researcher looking for industry roles starting February 2025.

During my undergraduate studies, I was first interested in combining my interests in mathematics and medicine. I stepped into research with cost-effectiveness modeling for a radioprotectant shield under Professor Giovanni Traverso. This resulted in my first publication. On a different project, I worked on a computer vision algorithm for a robotic triage of COVID-19 using a Boston Dynamics SPOT robot, which resulted in 2 publications and motivated my studies in EECS.

As a graduate student, I'm advised by Tomas Lozano-Perez and work in the Learning and Intelligent Systems group. I'm focused on leveraging large language models for household robots, using them for exploration in relational model-based reinforcement learning. I spent 3 of my summers working at NVIDIA on autonomous driving software as an intern.

Outside of the classroom/lab/office, I have a variety of hobbies. Growing up, music was a big part of my life, and during my undergraduate years, I performed music as an Emerson-Harris Piano Scholar and also played the French horn in the MIT Symphony orchestra. Now, I enjoy learning about AI, being outdoors (walking and running, hiking and climbing), and read nonfiction books.
